# bazaarBot2
This is a C# port of bazaarBot by @larsiusprime with several modifications to fix issues I think existed.  See this discussion for background:

It should run but is somewhat incomplete compared to the original in its output, json processing, etc.  If anyone wants to clean it up you have my thanks.

Note that I changed the name to EconomySim because I'm always stumbling over the spelling of "bazaar."
